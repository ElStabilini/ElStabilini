<h1 align="center"> Hi everyoneğŸ‘‹, I'm Elisa </h>

<center> I'm Elisa Stabilini, a Physics graduate interested in Quantum Computing.</center>

<p><strong>ğŸ”¬ Iâ€™m currently working on superconducting qubit control.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ğŸŒ± I'm deepening my understanding of quantum information theory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ğŸ“š Besides studying, I greatly enjoy reading literature and non-fiction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ğŸ”­ At some point, I would like to study tensor networks more formally.</strong></p>
